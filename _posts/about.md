## Bio

I’m Léo, a second year Computer Science student at the IUT of Bordeaux, France. I like fast software and low level optimization. I want to learn more about optimization techniques, data structures and algorithms and computer science in general. I learned most of my knowledge while doing personnel projects and by interest and not because of school, that’s why I’ll be happy to learn more even in my free time.

## Education

I will graduate from the Computer Science IUT of Bordeaux, France in 2024, with a Bachelor in Computer Science.
