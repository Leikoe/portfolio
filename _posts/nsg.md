# The Story of NSG and the NFT Trading Bot

NSG is a discord group that I created along with some friends during my journey into the world of NFTs and WEB3. Our goal was to stay informed about new NFT collections and find the best deals on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), a marketplace for buying and selling NFTs.

To achieve this, I decided to build a bot for our discord group that would notify us when new collections were revealed and also tell us which NFTs were currently the cheapest on OpenSea. This way, we could quickly buy these NFTs and resell them for a profit.

I had never built an app this big before, so I decided to use this opportunity to learn a new programming language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's a low-level language that is known for its performance and memory safety.

As I was building the bot, I encountered several performance issues and reached out to a friend who helped me with brainstorming and optimization. This experience taught me a lot about how to optimize code and improve performance, which was especially valuable after working on my previous project, the Stonks bot.

Through building this bot, I not only gained valuable programming experience, but I was also able to make some profits by buying and reselling NFTs. Overall, it was a great learning experience and I am excited to see what other opportunities the world of NFTs and WEB3 has to offer.
