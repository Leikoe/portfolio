# Stairs.io: My First Mobile Game

As a beginner game developer, I wanted to create a mobile game that would not only be fun to play, but also serve as an educational tool for myself. I decided to create a reversed version of the popular game Flappy Bird, which I named Stairs.io.

During the development process, I utilized the Unity engine and learned the C# programming language. This was my first experience with C# and it was a valuable learning experience for me.

The gameplay of Stairs.io is simple yet challenging. The player controls a ball that is stationary at the bottom of the screen, while the pipes (in the form of stairs) move towards the player. The player must tap the screen to make the world go up, avoiding the pipes as they descend.

Overall, creating Stairs.io was a great learning experience for me. Not only did I improve my skills in Unity and C#, but I also gained a better understanding of game development as a whole. I hope that others can also enjoy playing my game and perhaps even learn something new from it.
