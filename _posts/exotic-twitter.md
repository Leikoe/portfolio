# Twitter as a Notification API for Hypixel Skyblock

## Introduction

Twitter is a widely used social media platform that can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a notification API. This paper will discuss the use of twitter as a notification API for the game Hypixel Skyblock, and how it was used to gain an advantage in the game's marketplace.

## Background

Hypixel Skyblock is a popular Minecraft-based game that features a player-driven marketplace. Players can buy and sell items, and the prices for these items are determined by supply and demand. However, certain items in the game are extremely rare and unobtainable, and many players do not know the value of these items.

## Methodology

To take advantage of this, a twitter bot account was created and made private. This account was used to monitor the ingame market for the sale of these rare items. A python script was written to use the game's public REST API to gather data on the marketplace and send tweets using the twitter API. The tweets were set to mention the player's twitter account, allowing for push notifications on the player's phone.

## Results

This system allowed the player to receive notifications when rare items were put up for sale on the marketplace. This gave the player a significant advantage in the marketplace, as they were able to quickly purchase these items before other players knew they were available. This led to significant profits, as the player was able to buy these items at a low price and resell them for a much higher price.

## Conclusion

Twitter can be used as an effective notification API for games like Hypixel Skyblock. By using a private twitter bot account, a python script, and the game's public REST API, players can take advantage of market inefficiencies and gain significant profits. This method can be applied to other games with player-driven marketplaces and could be used for other purposes such as tracking stock prices, auction bids and more.
