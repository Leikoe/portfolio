### Stonks

This was my main project for almost 2 years, it is a sniping tool for the game Hypixel Skyblock, it's a bot which scans the ingame market 24/7 and notifies you when an item has been put up for sale for too low, which you can then easely buy with the keybinds of the `ingame mod` or from the `discord bot` feed. I started the project alone and in mid 2021, I met Refactor, a friend who helped me with the project and taught me `c++` aswell as `flask`. This project taught me almost everything I know about low level programming, optimisation, algorithms and networks.
