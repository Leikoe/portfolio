When I saw my parents play a little scrabble like mobile game, I had the idea of making a bot which plays the game by itself using the scrabble dictionnary (which i had to store in a specific made data structure for lookup performance). Using tesseract to get the board letters into python and using DFS to find the possible words. PYautoGUI was also used to fake mouse inputs and let python play the game on an Android emulator (NOX). This project taught me python oop, aswell as OCR and pyautogui + it was the early introduction to data structures and algorithmic optimisation for me.
