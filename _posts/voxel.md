A simple 3d voxel game engine made in **WindowsForms** **.NET**

In class we were taught how to draw lines, points and circles in a windows forms .NET application. I had the idea of making a game loop using the **Invalidate()** method, which allowed me to then make a rendering engine using matrix maths. This turned into a mincraft clone. This project mostly made me more comfortable about using matrices and Trigonometry.
