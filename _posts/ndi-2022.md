# What is it ?

a VueJs Website made during a national all nighter coding challenge

I participated to the french NDI (nuit de l'info) / Computer science night, we had to make a new website for Breton lifeguards. There were optinnal challenges we could take part in as a team in addition to the main challenge of the night (making the site). We chose to go all in for the dark mode challenge. We made the frontend in VueJs, Backend in PHP and used mySQL as the database for the site. We had to fill in our new site with some of their original site's data, and instead of doing it by hand, I used python to scrap the old website's data and fill up our database.
